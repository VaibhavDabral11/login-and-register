# bcrypt 

bcryptjs is a JavaScript library that allows developers to hash and compare passwords in a secure way. It uses the bcrypt algorithm to perform one-way encryption of passwords, which means that passwords are transformed into a hashed form that is impossible (or at least very difficult) to reverse back to the original text.

bcryptjs adds a salt to the hashing process, which makes it harder for attackers to use precomputed tables of hashes to crack passwords. By using a unique salt for each password, even if two users have the same password, their hashed passwords will be different, making it more difficult to attack a system.

bcryptjs provides an easy-to-use API for generating hashes and comparing them against stored password hashes. It also includes a work factor that can be configured to increase the amount of time it takes to generate a hash, which makes it more difficult for attackers to perform brute-force attacks on password hashes.

Overall, bcryptjs is a useful library for developers who need to securely store and compare password hashes in their applications. It helps to protect against common password-based attacks and provides a simple way to implement secure password storage.
